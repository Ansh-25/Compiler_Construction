## Compiler Construction Project


- [x] DFA making
- [x] hash function code
- [ ] lexer inplementation
- [ ] grammar completion
- [ ] parser implementation

### Lexer implementation
**To-Do :** 
1. Complete swith cases in function `Lexer()`
    - Start state Ansh
    - State 1-10 Nikhil
    - State 11-20 Shreekar
    - State 21-30 Sriram
    - State 31-39 Toshit

2. Create string to real/integer convertor and store exponent values also.

3. Create saperate header files for lexer and parser implementation.

4. merging and testing of lexer and tokenize.

### ! Important points ###

1. Refer the DFA_scan.pdf for state numbers and call function `tokenize()` whenever in a delimiter state. 

2. *Keep code well commented* and write your name in comment of any function or important code you write.

3. Create saperate files for testing of any function/utility and then merge. eg: hash_testing.c

4. Keep case naming of functions as *camelCase* or *underscore_saperated*.

### Basic Git Commands ###

For checking current branch: ` git branch`
For creting new branch off main: `git branch <branch_name>`
For changing branch: `git checkout <branch_name>`
For updating local branch:  `git pull`
For updating remote branch: `git push`
for deleting branch locally: `git branch -d <branch_name>`
for deleting branch remotely: `git push origin --delete <branch_name>`
